Richmond Ca has a high saturation in streetwear, creative arts, mural/graffiti culture, music studios, and tech-enabled fashion/app hybrids. It is a major culture hub, so competition is real—but also potential is huge.
There are many brands, creative studios, production hubs, and mural artists already operating. That means you’ll need strong differentiation (brand voice, community, design style, drop exclusivity, etc.).

7. What are zoning laws? Take the location you chose in question 4. Research and find one zoning law that applies to the type of your business idea.
(Ex. Search "Zoning law for mobile retail in Richmond, CA")

Zoning laws are city rules that control how land and buildings can be used, such as whether an area allows homes, retail stores, or studios. In Oakland, a business like BayDrip Empire would need a Zoning Clearance Permit to confirm its location fits the city’s Community Commercial (CC-2) zone, which allows retail and creative spaces under certain conditions.
